###Intro Resources
######Designed to familiarize you with basic language constructs
* [Installing Ruby](http://ruby.learncodethehardway.org/book/ex0.html)
* [Installing a Text Editor](https://github.com/textmate/textmate)
  * Text Editors let you write ruby code that you can run on your own computer.  


###Intro Resources
######Designed to familiarize you with basic language constructs

* [CodeAcademy](http://www.codecademy.com/tracks/ruby)
  * Not my favorite resource, but the most beginner friendly.  If you feel like you're moving too slowly, move on to the other resources.   
* [Learn Ruby the Hard Way](http://ruby.learncodethehardway.org/)  
* [RubyMonk](https://rubymonk.com/)  
* [RubyKoans](http://rubykoans.com/) 

###Intermediate Resources
######Designed to get you thinking more critically.   Incrementally more self directed resources.  

* [Test First Teaching](http://testfirst.org/learn_ruby)
  *  My personal favorite resources out of all the others here.  
  * Knowing a little bit aobut [Rspec](http://rspec.codeschool.com/levels/1) is necessary to use this. 
* [Ruby Warrior](https://github.com/ryanb/ruby-warrior)
  * A fun ruby game where you controller a player.  Not 100% necessary, but engaging.   

###Project Ideas
*  Do you have some sort of repittious task with excel that you do at work? Does a friend? Automate it!  
  * Check [out](http://blog.bignerdranch.com/1626-use-ruby-to-generate-formatted-excel-documents/) [these](http://roo.rubyforge.org/) [gems](https://github.com/cxn03651/writeexcel) to see if they might help!  They provide an interface between Ruby and Excel documents.  
* Write a script that downloads all the youtube videos from a webpage [like](http://ask.metafilter.com/254416/I-need-80s-instrumental-sex-music) this one.    

###Advanced Resources 
######
* [Meta-Programming](http://ruby-metaprogramming.rubylearning.com/)
  * Advanced topic in Ruby.  Probably not necessary, but really cool.   
* [Matsuono Crypto Challenges](http://www.matasano.com/articles/crypto-challenges/)
  * These may or may not still be functioning.  If they don't reply, reach out to me.      

### Courses

* [Intro](http://pragprog.com/book/ltp2/learn-to-program)
  * If you prefer a book as a way to learn, this one is very beginner friendly.  If you use this, make sure to do all the exercises contained within.  

###Other Skills
* [Git](http://gitimmersion.com/)
  * Git is THE way to control, save, and share your code.  Once you write your first .rb file, start learning Git.
