#How to Teach Yourself How to Program

###Installation
######Install these before moving on!
* [Installing Ruby](http://ruby.learncodethehardway.org/book/ex0.html)
* [Installing a Text Editor](https://github.com/textmate/textmate)
  * Text Editors let you write ruby code that you can run on your own computer.  

###Intro Resources
######Designed to familiarize you with basic language constructs
* [Why's Poignant Guide to Ruby](http://mislav.uniqpath.com/poignant-guide/book/chapter-1.html)
  * Amazing, etertaing book.  Will get you off on the right start.  Illustrates the depth of Ruby's community.  
* [CodeAcademy](http://www.codecademy.com/tracks/ruby)
  * Not my favorite resource, but the most beginner friendly.  If you feel like you're moving too slowly, move on to the other resources.   
* [Learn Ruby the Hard Way](http://ruby.learncodethehardway.org/)  
* [RubyMonk](https://rubymonk.com/)  
* [RubyKoans](http://rubykoans.com/) 
* [Ruby Warrior](https://github.com/ryanb/ruby-warrior)
  * A fun ruby game where you controller a player.  Not 100% necessary, but engaging.   
  
###Intermediate Resources
######Designed to get you thinking more on your own.   Incrementally more self directed resources.  
* [Test First Teaching](http://testfirst.org/learn_ruby)
  *  My personal favorite resources out of all the others here.  
  *  Knowing a little bit aobut [Rspec](http://rspec.codeschool.com/levels/1) is necessary to use this. 

###Project Ideas
###### Solve your own problems!  Make coding useful for your own life!
*  Do you have some sort of repittious task with excel that you do at work? Does a friend? Automate it!  
  * Check [out](http://blog.bignerdranch.com/1626-use-ruby-to-generate-formatted-excel-documents/) [these](http://roo.rubyforge.org/) [gems](https://github.com/cxn03651/writeexcel) to see if they might help!  They provide an interface between Ruby and Excel documents.  
* Write a script that downloads all the youtube videos from a webpage [like](http://ask.metafilter.com/254416/I-need-80s-instrumental-sex-music) this one.    

###Advanced Resources 
######These will push you. 
* [Meta-Programming](http://ruby-metaprogramming.rubylearning.com/)
  * Advanced topic in Ruby.  Probably not necessary, but really cool.   
* [Matsuono Crypto Challenges](http://www.matasano.com/articles/crypto-challenges/)
  * These may or may not still be functioning.  If they don't reply, reach out to me.      

### Courses
######Most courses in the below sites use languages other than Ruby.  However, they'll go over the intricacies of writing code in much more expansive ways.  It'd probably be good to take a course.  
* [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/)
* [EDX](https://www.edx.org/course/harvardx/harvardx-cs50x-introduction-computer-1022)
* [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/course/cs101)
* [Treehouse](https://teamtreehouse.com/)

###Books
* [Scripting](http://pragprog.com/book/bmsft/everyday-scripting-with-ruby)
  * Scripting is the process of making ruby code that does things for you - you can automate parts of your computing life.    
* [Intro](http://pragprog.com/book/ltp2/learn-to-program)
  * If you prefer a book as a way to learn, this one is very beginner friendly.  If you use this, make sure to do all the exercises contained within.  
  
###Ruby Resources  
* [Ruby Source Documents](http://www.ruby-doc.org/core-2.1.0/String.html)
  * What exactly can you do with a String, again?  Go here to remind yourself.  
* [Stack Overfloew](www.stackoverflow.com)
  * You're stuck?  Everyone on the internet is stuck.  This is where they go to solve their problems.  

###Other Skills
* [Git](http://gitimmersion.com/)
  * Git is THE way to control, save, and share your code.  Once you write your first .rb file, start learning Git.    
* [The Command Line](http://cli.learncodethehardway.org/book/)
  * 100% necessary for learning how to interact with your computer and the code that it is running.
